This file is a genuine encryption file. It loads your %Users% folder, starting with My Documents, My Music, My Videos, My Pictures, file by file within each folder.

I mean it, it WILL encrypt your files with .meow suffix but ONLY when you skip the checks in place to prevent it from happening, aka you make it play. 
If in doubt, breakpoint cryptencrypt which is the main function involved with encrypting files. 

IsDebugger x2 checks in place to prevent mindlessness, but after that, you're left to your own problems if you make a mistake

File for zip is ENCRYPTION MEOW HURTS ME with no spaces!
