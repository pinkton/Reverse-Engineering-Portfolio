# Reverse-Engineering-Portfolio
Crackme's that I've found across the interweb, and the way I solved them. All credits to original owners are attached. 

# Portfolio
I realised that to get into the wider world of revers engineering as a job and no longer a hobby/interest, I would need a location of 'proof in the pudding' of my work. As such, I originally used my Google Drive but felt uneasy potentially linking my personal space and working space in the same area. Thus, GitHub seemed the only natural solution.

# License
I do not own any of these uploaded softwares, and as such, have linked to the corresponding websites that I have found them. In addition, should there not be a website, I have creditted the original creator (which mostly is from the TechVets community) 

Should this be wrong, please dm me on Discord Pinkton#0693 and I will adjust any license disputes.

# In case it was missed
Ending note. Again, this is not my work, but the tutorials are how I personally 'cracked' them.
