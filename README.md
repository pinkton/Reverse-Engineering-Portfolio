# Reverse-Engineering-Portfolio
Crackme's that I've found across the interweb, and the way I solved them. All credits to original owners are attached. 
There is also a folder of challenges that I have created, albeit with my limited coding knowledge, to use as demo's for teaching with source code in .txt files/.cpp files

# Portfolio
I realised that to get into the wider world of reverse engineering as a job and no longer a hobby/interest, I would need a location of 'proof in the pudding' of my work. As such, I originally used my Google Drive but felt uneasy potentially linking my personal and working in the same area. Thus, GitHub seemed the only natural solution.

# License (For ALL folders EXCEPT Created Challenges)
I do not own any of these uploaded softwares, and as such, have linked to the corresponding websites that I have found them. In addition, should there not be a website, I have creditted the original creator (which mostly is from the TechVets community) 

Should this be wrong, please dm me on Discord Pinkton#0693 and I will adjust any license disputes.

# License (For Created Challenges)
They are nothing special, with no personal information. They do however contain the TechVet CTF Discord Group Icon, and have reference to my handle @Pinkton (Or Pink)
I am happy for all to use but please give what little credit is due if you use them.

# In case it was missed
Ending note. Again, this is not my work, but the tutorials are how I personally 'cracked' them.
